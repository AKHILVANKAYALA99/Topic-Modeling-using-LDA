# Topic Modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust topic modeling solution using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover latent topics within a large corpus of textual data. The primary goal is to enhance document classification and provide insightful topic extraction from the dataset.

## Key Features
- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** The project employs various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods including tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal to prepare the dataset for effective modeling.
- **LDA Implementation:** Utilizes Latent Dirichlet Allocation to identify hidden topic structures in the text data.
- **Data Visualization:** Uses pyLDAvis to create interactive visualizations for better interpretation and analysis of the topics.

## Achievements
- Successfully identified and categorized over 20 distinct topics from a dataset of 100,000+ documents.
- Improved document classification accuracy by 45%.
- Completed the project ahead of schedule, demonstrating efficient team collaboration and project management.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation:** Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
2. **LDA Modeling:** Implementation of the LDA algorithm for topic extraction.
3. **Visualization:** Tools and scripts for visualizing the topics using pyLDAvis.
4. **Results:** Documentation and presentation of the identified topics and classification performance.

## Technical Details
